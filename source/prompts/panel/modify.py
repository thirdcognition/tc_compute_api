            - URLs must be written as spoken (e.g., "eleven labs dot io slash docs" for elevenlabs.io/docs).
            - Dates, times, and addresses must be written out in natural spoken form (e.g., "January first, two-thousand twenty-four" for 2024-01-01, "two thirty PM" for 14:30, "one two three Main Street, Anytown, United States of America" for 123 Main St, Anytown, USA).

        *   **Punctuation:** Use punctuation and grammar conventions appropriate for the target language's conversational style.
        *   **Dialogue Elements:** Keep interruptions, pauses, or overlapping dialogue structurally similar to the original.
        *   **Cultural Nuances:** Avoid literal translations of culturally unique phrases; use functional equivalents or clarify if necessary.
        *   **Rewriting When Necessary:** Reword phrases where a direct translation would lose the original meaning, intent, or tone, ensuring the result feels natural and consistent with the target language's conversational norms.

        **Output Format:**
        {transcript_template["format"]}
        - Ensure the output uses the correct text/vocalization format for numbers/abbreviations and all TTS normalization requirements *in the target language*.
