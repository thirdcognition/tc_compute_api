</think>
<output>
<person1>Social media connects people in powerful ways, but it also creates challenges. Many feel pressured to present perfect lives, which impacts mental health.</person1>
<person2>The design of the platforms drives that. Algorithms push highly curated content, encouraging comparison and reinforcing those unhealthy habits.</person2>
<person1>That comparison can lead to anxiety and loneliness. People see highlight reels and start questioning their own lives, often without realizing the impact it has on them.</person1>
<person2>I see that too. The platforms also use features like endless scrolling to keep people engaged. It’s a system built to hold attention, not encourage reflection.</person2>
<person1>There’s also the issue of privacy. Most users don’t fully understand how much of their data is being collected or how it’s being used, which creates another layer of concern.</person1>
<person2>That’s a big one, Emma. Data isn’t just collected—it’s analyzed, sold, and sometimes misused. Taking control over privacy settings can be an important first step, but the platforms don’t make it easy.</person2>
<person1>And for mental health, boundaries are just as important. Limiting screen time, being mindful about why you’re engaging, and having open conversations can help shift the experience to something healthier.</person1>
<person2>Agreed. Intentional use is key. Social media can connect and empower, but only if you approach it with awareness and set limits that work for you.</person2>
